Email-ARF-Report-AOL version 0.01
=================================

This was an early attempt to add some internal support for abuse email processing.

This was done by extending the an existing module to extract specific required details for
the companies individual needs.

The code however was never utilised.

From recent research it also appears that the specification for xarf reporting has changed slightly.
Hence this code may not be as functional as it had once been.

I have added some useful links which may be of use moving forard.
