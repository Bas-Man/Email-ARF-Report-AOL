 Reflections on Life in Japan by Taras A. Sak: Guests and Hosts in 
 Japan, Part I

 Philosophers have reminded us that the word "host" is related to 
 "hostage," and that the distance between hospitality and hostility is 
 less than we would like to think. In some languages, such as French 
 (with the term "l'hote"), the distinction between host and guest is 
 either unknown or ambiguous at best. In any case, it is an 
 interesting example of a relational concept, regardless of the language 
 involved, which cannot stand in isolation - to be a host, in other 
 words, one needs a guest.

 Terrie's Job Tips: The Power of Stories as a Recruiting Tool

 Apart from money, the main reason people join a company is because of 
 an emotional resonance they feel after reading or hearing about some 
 particular aspect of that company which indicates that it would be a 
 good place to work. This aspect of recruiting is very important, 
 because it causes good candidates to choose companies that otherwise 
 aren't sufficiently mainstream or famous enough to normally 
 attract them.

======================================================================
 Who Wants to Find a Job?

 Did you know that when companies/recruiters search for candidates, 
 they usually contact people with recently updated resumes?

 By frequently updating your resume, you can show: 
 - Your enthusiasm for potential opportunities
 - The skills and experiences you have gained since the last time
   you updated your resume 

 Update your resume today!
